# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal Python repository!  
This repo contains everything I’m learning in Python – from basic syntax to more advanced concepts – along with exercises, notes, and mini-projects.

## 🚀 About This Repository

This repository is my digital notebook where I:

- Practice Python programming through hands-on coding
- Solve exercises from books, tutorials, and online platforms
- Build small projects to reinforce understanding
- Track my progress and share with others

All content is written and practiced by me during my learning process. Regular updates will be made as I continue exploring Python deeper.
